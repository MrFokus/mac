1Betty Botter bought some butter
But, said she, the butter's bitter.
If I put it in my batter,
it will make my batter bitter.
5But a bit of better butter
will make my bitter batter better.
7So she bought some better butter,
8better than the bitter butter,
put it in her bitter batter,
made her bitter batter better.
So it was better
Betty Botter bought some better butter.
